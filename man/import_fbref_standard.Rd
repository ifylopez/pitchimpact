\description{
Imports an FBref "Standard Stats" table (common workflow: FBref -> copy/paste into
Google Sheets -> export CSV) and returns a cleaned, standardized data frame
with one row per player-season.
}
\details{
The export often includes a first row with group labels ("Standard", "Expected")
and a trailing "Matches" column. Use \code{header_row} to specify which row contains
the real headers (typically 2).

The function keeps season totals only and removes duplicated per-90 columns.
Per-90 metrics should be recomputed later from minutes and nineties.

Nationality and position fields are standardized:
nationality is split into a raw field (\code{nation_raw}) and a cleaned
three-letter country code (\code{nation_code}), while positions are parsed into
primary and secondary roles (\code{pos_primary}, \code{pos_secondary}) when applicable.
