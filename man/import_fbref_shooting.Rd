}

\item{path}{Path to the CSV file exported from Google Sheets.}

\item{team}{Team name to attach as context (e.g., "Rosario Central").}

\item{season}{Season label to attach as context (numeric or character).}

\item{header_row}{Integer. The row (1-indexed) containing the real headers.
Default is 2 for a Google Sheets export.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Imports an FBref "Shooting" table (common workflow: FBref -> copy/paste into
Google Sheets -> export CSV) and returns a cleaned, standardized data frame
with one row per player-season.
}
\details{
The export often includes a first row with group labels ("Standard", "Expected")
and a trailing "Matches" column. Use \code{header_row} to specify which row contains
the real headers (typically 2).

Note: Google Sheets may convert the columns "G-xG" and "np:G-xG" into formulas
and export "#ERROR!". This function ignores those raw values and recomputes:
\itemize{
\item goals_minus_xg = goals - xg
\item non_pen_goals_minus_npxg = (goals - pens_made) - npxg
}
}
