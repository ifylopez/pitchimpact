\description{
Imports an FBref "Possession" table (FBref -> copy/paste into Google Sheets ->
export CSV) and returns a cleaned, standardized data frame with one row per
player-season.
}
\details{
The export includes a first row with group labels; \code{header_row} specifies the
row containing the true headers (typically 2). This function keeps the season
totals columns present in the Sheets export and ignores the trailing "Matches"
column.
}
