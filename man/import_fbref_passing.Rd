\item{season}{Season label to attach as context (numeric or character).}

\item{header_row}{Integer. Row (1-indexed) containing the real headers.

}
\description{
Imports an FBref "Passing" table (FBref -> copy/paste into Google Sheets -> CSV)
and returns a cleaned, standardized data frame with one row per player-season.
}
\details{
The export usually contains a first row with group labels and duplicated or
formula-broken columns. Use \code{header_row} to specify the real header row
(typically 2 for Google Sheets exports).

Google Sheets may convert the column "Assists minus expected goals assisted"
into a formula and export "#ERROR!". This function ignores the raw value and
recomputes it as: assists - xag.
