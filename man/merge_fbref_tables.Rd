\description{
Joins standardized FBref tables into a single player-season dataset keyed by
team, season, and player. When \code{standard} is provided, overlapping columns
from other tables are joined with table-specific suffixes (e.g. \verb{_shooting})
and then dropped, keeping the \code{standard} version as source of truth.
