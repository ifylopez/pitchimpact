Description: Tools for analyzing football (soccer) player and team performance using
    match-level and season-level data. The package provides functions to
    standardize datasets from different data sources, compute per-90-minute
    metrics, evaluate player influence and contribution, and generate
    interpretable summaries and visualizations. Designed to be data-source
    agnostic, pitchimpact can be applied to any team or competition and is
    intended as a foundation for performance analysis in professional football
    contexts.
